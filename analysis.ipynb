    "Some requirements: \n",
    "1. This notebook must clearly **show all the work necessary to answer each question** in the Google Form.\n",
    "1. **Your code must unambiguously show that you have answered each question**.  For questions where you are unable to determine the answer using code, include descriptive text explaining what you believe to be the answer, and any reason you are unable to show it in the code.\n",
    "1. All code in this notebook must be **well-documented using Markdown**.  Indicate each question you are answering and clearly describe what each block of code is doing.  Your ability to write well-formatted Markdown that clearly explains your work will be factored into your grade.\n",
    "1. Once you have determined the answer to each question, remember to **enter the answer for each question into the Google Form** - we need both this notebook and the completed Google Form in order to grade your work.\n",
    "1. Save this notebook and **push this repository to GitHub when done**.\n"
